# System Users, Responsibilities, and End-to-End Operating Scenario

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains every authenticated user role currently implemented in the system, how each account is created, what work each role performs, what information each role can access, and how all roles work together from school registration through the end of an academic year.

It can be used for customer demonstrations, staff onboarding, access-control reviews, and workflow planning.

## 2. Important Access-Control Terms

### Role

A role is the user's main position in the system. It provides default permissions and determines the user's main dashboard.

The implemented authenticated roles are:

1. Platform Owner
2. School Super Admin
3. Finance Director
4. Branch Admin
5. Registrar
6. Teacher
7. Cashier
8. Student
9. Parent

### Scope

Scope controls which organization's data a user may access:

- Platform scope: the SaaS platform and customer schools' platform status.
- Tenant scope: one school organization and all its branches, subject to permissions.
- Branch scope: one assigned school branch, subject to permissions.
- Personal scope: the user's own records or specifically linked children's records.

### Permission

A permission controls a specific action, such as viewing students, recording a payment, or managing branches. Each role receives default permissions. Authorized administrators can grant or deny selected custom permissions, but custom permissions cannot be used to escape the user's allowed role and data scope.

## 3. Complete User List and Account Ownership

| Branch Admin | `branch_admin` | One assigned branch | School Super Admin | Branch Admin Portal |
| Registrar | `registrar` | One assigned branch | Branch Admin or authorized School Super Admin | Registrar Portal |
| Teacher | `teacher` | Assigned branch and teaching assignments | Branch Admin or authorized School Super Admin | Teacher Portal |
| Cashier | `cashier` | One assigned branch | Branch Admin or authorized School Super Admin | Cashier Portal |
| Student | `student` | Own records | Registrar admission process or authorized school staff | Student Portal |

### Responsibilities

- Open the public school-registration page.
- Provide the school's identity, contact details, and initial administrator information.
- Submit the registration request for platform review.
- Wait for approval before trying to operate the school.

### What Happens After Submission

- A new school tenant is created in `Pending` status.

### Account Creation

#### High-Level Branch Operations

## 16. How the Features Work Together

The workflow depends on clear handoffs:

1. The Platform Owner activates the school.
2. The School Super Admin creates school structure, academic year, senior finance user, and Branch Admins.
3. The Branch Admin creates academic structures, staff, assignments, exams, and timetables.
4. The Registrar creates students and enrollments.
5. The Finance Director turns enrollments and fee structures into invoices.
6. The Cashier records payments against those invoices.
7. The Teacher uses assignments and enrollment rosters to submit attendance and results.
8. The Student and Parent receive restricted read-only access to relevant information.
9. Authorized administrators promote students into a new enrollment without deleting the previous academic year.

No single user should perform every task. One role's output becomes another role's authorized input.

## 17. Data Preservation Rules

### Promotion and Re-Enrollment

Promotion and re-enrollment must create a new enrollment for the new academic year. They must not replace the old enrollment.

The previous academic year must retain:

- enrollment and class;
- attendance records;
- exam results and marks;
- invoices;
- payment transactions;
- receipts;
- relevant reports and audit history.

### Transfers

A branch transfer must preserve the student's prior branch and enrollment history. The transfer changes the student's current operational context without deleting valid past records.

### Financial Corrections

Payment corrections should use the supported reversal or correction workflow. A valid historical transaction should not silently disappear.

### User Deactivation

Deactivating a staff account should prevent future access without deleting historical records created by that user.
